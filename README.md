# Sudoku-Solver

Created a SudokuSolver class and a program which asks a user to input a sudoku puzzle row by row, stores this information in a self.grid attribute, makes checks for validity of the information provided, uses a recursive algorithm named backtracking to solve the puzzle and then displays the solved puzzle and the time taken to solve it.
